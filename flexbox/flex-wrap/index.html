                    <h2>Software</h2>
                    <p>Set of instructions or programs that tell the hardware what to do.</p>
                    <p>Intangible — cannot be touched or seen physically.</p>
                    <p>Developed using programming languages and tools.</p>
                    <p>Does not wear out physically but can become outdated or corrupted.</p>
                    <p>Cannot function without hardware to run on.</p>
                    <p>Examples: Operating system, MS Word, web browser, games.</p>
                    <p>Designed and developed by software programmers.</p>
                    <p>Can be easily updated, reinstalled, or upgraded.</p>
                    <p>Speed depends on how efficiently it is coded.</p>

                    <p>Physical components of a computer system.</p>
                    <p>Tangible — you can touch and see it (e.g., keyboard, monitor, CPU).</p>
                    <p>Manufactured using electronic and mechanical parts.</p>
                    <p>Subject to wear and tear over time.</p>
                    <p>Cannot perform any task without software.</p>
                    <p>Examples: Motherboard, hard drive, RAM, printer.</p>
                    <p>Designed by hardware engineers.</p>
                    <p>Replacement is costly and often requires physical repair.</p>

                    <h2>computer</h2>
                    <p>Definition: A computer is an electronic device that processes data to produce meaningful information.</p>
                    <p>Main Units: It has three main parts — Input unit, Processing unit (CPU), and Output unit.</p>
                    <p>Input Devices: Devices like keyboard, mouse, and scanner are used to enter data.</p>
                    <p>Output Devices: Devices like monitor and printer display or produce results.</p>
                    <p>Memory: Computers use primary memory (RAM, ROM) and secondary memory (hard drive, SSD) to store data.</p>
                    <p>Speed: Computers can process data much faster than humans.</p>
                    <p>Accuracy: They perform tasks with high accuracy and minimal errors.</p>
