                    <h2>about computer</h2>
                    <p>A computer is an electronic device that processes data and performs tasks according to instructions given by software.</p>
                    <p>Computers perform four main functions — input, processing, output, and storage.</p>
                    <p>A computer system includes hardware (physical parts like CPU, keyboard, monitor) and software (programs and applications).</p>
                    <p>The CPU is the “brain” of the computer — it executes instructions and manages all operations.</p>
                    <p>Computers use RAM (temporary memory) and storage devices (like hard drives or SSDs) to store data.</p>
                    <p>Devices such as the keyboard, mouse, scanner, and microphone are used to input data into the computer.</p>
                    <p>Devices like monitors, printers, and speakers display or produce the results of computer processing.</p>
                    <p>Computers can be connected in networks to share information and resources; the largest network is the Internet.</p>
                    <p>Computers are used in almost every field — education, business, healthcare, banking, research, and entertainment.</p>

                    <h2>about mobiles</h2>
                    <p>A mobile phone is a portable electronic device used for communication, such as making calls, sending messages, and accessing the internet.</p>
                    <p>Mobiles are compact and lightweight, allowing users to carry them anywhere easily.</p>
                    <p>They enable voice calls, video calls, and text messaging, making instant communication possible worldwide.</p>
                    <p>Modern mobile phones, known as smartphones, function like mini-computers with internet access and apps.</p>
                    <p>Common mobile operating systems include Android, iOS, and HarmonyOS.</p>
                    <p>Mobiles use apps for various purposes — social media, education, gaming, banking, and navigation.</p>
                    <p>With Wi-Fi or mobile data, phones provide access to the internet, email, and online services.</p>
                    <p>Most phones have built-in cameras, music players, and video recording features.</p>
                    <p>Mobile phones support Bluetooth, GPS, and NFC, allowing connection with other devices and location tracking.</p>

                    <h2>about laptops</h2>
                    <p>A laptop is a portable computer that combines all the components of a desktop (monitor, keyboard, CPU, and battery) into one compact device.</p>
                    <p>Laptops are lightweight and easy to carry, making them ideal for students, professionals, and travelers.</p>
                    <p>They can run on battery power or be plugged into an electrical outlet, allowing flexible use anywhere.</p>
                    <p>A laptop includes a screen, keyboard, touchpad, speakers, camera, and ports for USB and other devices.</p>
                    <p>Common laptop operating systems are Windows, macOS, Linux, and ChromeOS.</p>
                    <p>Laptops are used for education, office work, programming, design, gaming, and communication.</p>
                    <p>Laptops offer mobility and convenience, but may have shorter battery life and higher repair costs compared to desktops.</p>
