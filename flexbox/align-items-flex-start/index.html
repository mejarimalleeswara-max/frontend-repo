                    <h2>About cats</h2>
                    <p>Cats are natural hunters with sharp claws, quick reflexes, and the ability to run up to 30 miles per hour.</p>
                    <p>They have a keen sense of smell and hearing, able to detect higher frequencies than humans</p>
                    <p>While they mainly meow at humans, they use body language, purring, and a variety of other sounds (over 100) to communicate with each other and with people</p>
                    <p>Cats have a flexible spine and a "righting reflex" that allows them to almost always land on their feet when they fall, a trait aided by their lack of a collarbone and flexible ears.</p>
                    <p>They spend about 70% of their day sleeping, often 14-16 hours, to conserve energy for hunting.</p>
