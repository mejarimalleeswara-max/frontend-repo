                    <p>Objective:The main goal in volleyball is to send the ball over the net and ground it on the opponent's court, while preventing the opponent from doing the same.</p>
                    <p>Teams and Players  Each team has six players on the court at a time: three in the front row and three in the back row.</p>
                    <p>Scoring System Volleyball uses rally scoring, meaning a point is scored on every serve, regardless of which team served. Matches are usually best of five sets, with sets played to 25 points</p>
                    <p>Serving Each play begins with a serve from behind the end line. The server must hit the ball over the net into the opponent's court.</p>
                    <p>Rotations:After winning a serve back, players rotate clockwise before the next serve. This ensures everyone plays both front and back row positions.</p>
