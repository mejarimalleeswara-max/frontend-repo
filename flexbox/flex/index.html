                    <p>Over time, consistent interaction fosters trust, credibility, and stronger personal or professional bonds.</p>

                    <p>The web has nodes (people) and links (connections), forming patterns like clusters, hubs, and communities</p>
                    <p>Ideas, trends, and behaviors spread through these relationships — influential members can shape others' opinions</p>
                    <p>Effective networks depend on give-and-take — users contribute as much as they benefit.</p>
